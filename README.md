MoviePeers is a novelty website that helps users discover movies and roles that actors had when they were the same age as the user. It uses Python, Flask, GraphQL, and SQLAlchemy to fetch actor data, compare ages, and display relevant movies. The app includes a data pipeline using The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch and process actor and movie information to find age-specific matches.
